# Description

Github.com is a central hub for most open source projects, counting 56 million users it is the biggest hosting platform for storing a source code versioned by GIT. Yet it still manages to be highly underutilized. Correctly managed, github.com can be a proven record of your work and interests -a resume that can be used as a leverage in salary negotiation; a hosting platform to promote yourself or your projects; a CI/CD platform that delivers your software to millions; a fantastic collaborative tool for your team that facilitates communication among developers. Finally, github is my go-to place for solving daily programming challenges and fixations - say “Hasta la vista” stackoverflow.com. In this course you’ll build production ready microservice (with Flask) and deploy it to the central image registry (DockerHub) utilizing Github Actions as CI/CD pipeline. Once the project is done you’ll create a web page and a wiki to promote, maintain and collaborate on an open source project.
